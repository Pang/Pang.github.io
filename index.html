            <h4>Informatics Developer</h4>
            <h6>Aug 2019 – Present</h6>
            <p>
                Here I am primarily working with technologies like .Net Core (C#) on the back-end and Angular (Javascript) on the front-end, 
                I have been a part of a great team who I am constantly learning from to create Web Applications which aid the work of the medical 
                and clinical staff around the hospital.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is no more than a dozen developers within our department however we keep to a tidy git repository workflow, constantly branching off and 
                reviewing each others work, taking turns with the on-call rota and making sure to have knowledge in each others specialities so that we never 
                have a point of failure. We utilise methods pertaining to Agile such as daily scrums and even when working remotely stay in calls throughout 
                the day to offer support if a colleague is struggling on a piece of code.

            <h4>Health Informatics Project Admin</h4>
            <h6>Aug 2018 – Aug 2019</h6>
            <p>
                In this role I managed proposals for new services, software and suppliers by collecting all the necessary details and presenting it to senior managers 
                within the trust. This involves looking at the advantages of bringing in the proposed solutions, what resources were required, how in-depth a data 
                protection impact assessment must be, finding better solutions etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another part of my role is to set up meetings for the project managers and external companies we are contracted to, take minutes and help test software 
                during it's pilot/upgrade. Finally I am responsible for the team's SharePoint website, which I have designed with the feedback of my peers; aiming to 
                the needs of my team and be as efficient as possible.

            <h4>Information Governance Officer</h4>
            <h6>Aug 2017 – Aug 2018</h6>
            <p>
                My main priorities in this role involved auditing the hospital wards and offices, discovering any possible risks/data breaches, advising staff members on any issues concerning data protection, 
                handling Freedom of Information requests and publication to the trust's disclosure log, training staff to be compliant in data protection, which was mandatory through the IG toolkit 
                (now Data Security and Protection Toolkit) and finally advising on projects from a data protection stand-point.
            </p>
            <p>
                During my time here I took a course on the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Data Protection Act 2018 since I was required to have an in-depth understanding of these legislation.

            <h6>Jun 2017 – Aug 2017</h6>
            <p>
                I was required to store and retrieve patient notes from around the hospital, trace them to the correct departments and prepare them in time for appointments. This means confirming all the 
                details for the patient inside are still correct by matching it to the system, putting together new folders if necessary and finding previous references from GP’s or other areas of the 
                hospital to place into the file.

                    with refactors and updates to use the latest version the frameworks it relies on. The main reason for this is because it's an
                    ideal project for me to test out any new features I want to play with but also to show how much I have learnt and where I am
                    in my coding journey.

                    This was part of an Angular course I took on to refresh my foundations of the Angular framework.
                    I did this in part to improve my understanding, understand how others used the framework and also
                    to see if this was a good stepping stone for my colleagues to upskill and get involved with in-house development.

          <h4>Procedural Terrain Generation</h4>
          <p class="my-4">
              For this project I began with a simple mesh generator, 100 x 100 vertices - and since you need 3 vertices 
              to create a triangle and 2 triangles to create a square, I ended up multiplying this by another 6 to give me 60,000
              vertices. This still wasn't enough to create the island size I was after so I scaled the mesh out by 50. Since I had
              set out to create a low-poly look, hence also flat-shading the map, this worked out quite well!
          </p>
          <p>
            The fun part was playing with perlin noise to get the desired landscape. I created a 'fall-off' map gradient which was subtracted from
            the original perlin noise height, lowering the edges so it would be presented as an island instead of appearing suddenly falling off the edge. 
            I created the shader for the land using Unity's PBR graph and set the Albedo to the Vertex Color of the Gradient property that belonged 
            to the Mesh Script, this was extremely helpful for creating beaches, separating forests and making the higher hills seem rockier, 
            based off the height of the vertices.

            This was my first project in Unity and I chose this as it involved pulling together multiple skillsets. Having just picked up
