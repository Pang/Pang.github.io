                A full stack web developer profficient in .Net Core technologies and front-end Javascript frameworks, primarily Angular and Vue.
                I currently work as a Software Developer / Dev Ops Engineer for the NHS, where my main focus is on the Nexus
                Electronic Patient Record. This is a multi-purpose system designed to improve upon the hospitals admission flow, having a clean
                interface to understand the wards current state and which patient needs tending to, as well as connecting together the PAS and
                other independant systems into one place for medical and administration staff to access.
            </p>
            <p>
                Second to this I am a Cofounder and developer of Copilot, this is a platform for Twitch data tools including but not limited to:
                profile design analytics, generated graphs to see how users interacted with your streams, music detection to avoid DMCA copyright 
                strikes and more. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Apart from web-development, I am also passionate about producing music, drawing, snowboarding, and making fun things in Unity :)

            <h3>Blackpool Teaching Hospital, UK</h3><br />

            <h4>Informatics Developer</h4>
            <h6>Aug 2019 – Present</h6>
            <p>
                Working with technologies like .Net Core (C#) and Angular/Vue (Javascript) on the front end, I have been a part of a great team to create software through web development which aids the work of the medical and clinical staff around the hospital. Other tools include Git, GitLab, SmartGit, Postman, Swagger, Mattermost, SQL and utilising methods pertaining to Agile such as daily scrums and the development life-cycle.
            </p><br/>

            <h4>Health Informatics Project Admin</h4>
            <h6>Aug 2018 – Aug 2019</h6>
            <p>
                In this role I manage proposals for new services, software and suppliers by collecting all the necessary details and presenting it to senior managers within the trust. This involves looking at the advantages of bringing in the proposal, what resources will be required, how in-depth a data protection impact assessment must be, finding better solutions etc.

                Another part of my role is to set up meetings for the project managers and external companies we are contracted to, take minutes and help test software during it's pilot/upgrade.
                Finally I am responsible for the team's SharePoint website, which I have designed with the feedback of my peers; aiming to fit the needs of my team and be as efficient as possible.
            </p><br/>

            <h4>Information Governance Officer</h4>
            <h6>Aug 2017 – Aug 2018</h6>
            <p>
                My main priorities in this role involved auditing the hospital wards and offices, discovering any possible risks/data breaches, advising staff members on any issues concerning data protection, handling Freedom of Information requests and publication to the trust's disclosure log, training staff to be compliant in data protection, which was mandatory through the IG toolkit (now Data Security and Protection Toolkit) and finally advising on projects
                During my time here I took a course on the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Data Protection Act 2018 since I was required to have an in-depth understanding of these legislation.
            </p><br/>

            <h4>Medical Records Clerk</h4>
            <h6>Jun 2017 – Aug 2017</h6>
            <p>
                I was required to store and retrieve patient notes from around the hospital, trace them to the correct departments and prepare them in time for appointments. This means confirming all the details for the patient inside are still correct by matching it to the system, putting together new folders if necessary and finding previous references from GP’s or other areas of the hospital to place into the file.

                    I am a cofounder and developer of Copilot, which is a collection of data tools for Twitch as 
                    well as a place to collaborate and gain insights with other streamers. The web application  
                    consists of all the following features. Allows user to browse your chat reactivity in a simple 
                    and easy to use graph to see your best moments based on emotes and phrases used in chat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It also allows you to scan your channel for accessibility issues, such as colorblindness colour 
                    schemes or patterns that may not suite your design. One if it's main features is allowing streamer to
                    maintain their copyright standing within livestreams and creative content in a trackable dashboard.
                </p>
                    Finally, you can do all of this collaboritively and invite other users, managers, or editors to be a
                    part of your profile and collaborate on your Copiloted stream content.

                Thoughtwall was my first project to learn Angular and DotnetCore. It has since gone through many iterations to 
                get to it's current state and uses technologies such as SignalR (Websockets/RPC's), Angular Material (Themes and 
                components) and Entity Framework Core (ORM). This app allows users to register and create threadposts where conversations
                can take place in real time.
