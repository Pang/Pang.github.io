                  I have been a part of a great team who I am constantly learning from to create Web Applications which aid the work of the medical

                  There is no more than a dozen developers within our department however we keep to a tidy git repository workflow, constantly branching off and 
                  reviewing each others work, taking turns with the on-call rota and making sure to have knowledge in each others specialities so that we never 
                  have a point of failure. We utilise methods pertaining to Agile such as daily scrums and even when working remotely stay in calls throughout 
                  the day to offer support if a colleague is struggling on a piece of code.

                  My main priorities in this role involved auditing the hospital wards and offices, discovering any possible risks/data breaches, advising staff members on any issues concerning data protection,

              For this project I began with a simple mesh generator, 100 x 100 vertices - and since you need 3 vertices 
              to create a triangle and 2 triangles to create a square, I ended up multiplying this by another 6 to give me 60,000
              vertices. This still wasn't enough to create the island size I was after so I scaled the mesh out by 50. Since I had
              set out to create a low-poly look, hence also flat-shading the map, this worked out quite well!
            </p>
            <p>
              The fun part was playing with perlin noise to get the desired landscape. I created a 'fall-off' map gradient which was subtracted from
              the original perlin noise height, lowering the edges so it would be presented as an island instead of suddenly appearing to fall off the edge. 
              I created the shader for the land using Unity's PBR graph and set the Albedo to the Vertex Color of the Gradient property that belonged 
              to the Mesh Script, that way I could use the height of each vertices to define beaches, grass and mountain-tops.

              This was my first project in Unity and I chose this as it involved pulling together multiple skillsets. Having just picked up
              a drawing pad and learning what Unity was capable off, this seemed like a great opportunity for learning and creating.
