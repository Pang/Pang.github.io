Features are planned as a team, then my role was to turn those specifications into a complete interface and help build the API/Models alongside it. One of my main priorities was to rebuild the web-app in MVC and develop additional features. I also helped to maintain the in-house content management system, which is used daily by the content team in order to create and edit subscription questions and learning resources, and finally picking up support tickets on the help-desk which contains issues raised from both customers and colleagues.</p>"

My main focus was on an in-house Electronic Patient Record known as Nexus, which aggregated together many third party systems as well as having its own functionality for admitting a patient, following their journey of care and maintaining an overview of each ward in the hospital - allowing for faster, more reliable information retrieval, quicker nurse and doctor handovers as well as more efficient patient flow, allowing for better placement of patients to wards more suited to their needs.</p>"
