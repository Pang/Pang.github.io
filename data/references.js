Having a developer who can be autonomous, but also works as a team member, brought us an elastic workflow for large technical challenges. Thanks to the active work he brought, our team could adapt and overcome problems with significant responsiveness, and deliver product features at the highest of quality.</p><p>Ryan oversaw a lot of front-end decisions and production-facing management very quickly from the start of the project, and quickly adapted to a codebase that wasnâ€™t immediately friendly. Seeing him easily pick up an unfamiliar framework (VueJS) from an Angular background was a good trait to see in a developer, something other teams would significantly benefit from - versatility and resilience.&rdquo;</p>",
