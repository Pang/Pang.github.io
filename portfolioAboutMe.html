    <h1 class="headertext"><u>The Longer Version</u></h1> <br><br>

<p class="longAM">Born in Manchester; studied Computer Software in college; clerked at a law firm for just under 2 years,
then decided to do a degree in Music Production which took me to study at Uclan in Preston. I found the love of my life during this time
and pursued a job in Blackpool to live with her which is how I ended up working for Blackpool Victoria Hospital.</p> <br />

<p class="longAM">My first position at the NHS was a Medical Records Clerk, this was not a role which challenged me and so caused me to aim higher. 
After a couple of months putting a lot of energy and overtime in, I was fortunate enough to find a place within Information governance. 
This was my first big step in my career there as it was a jump from band 1 to band 3; however it was less about the money to me 
and more about the sense of being part of the bigger picture. A demanding role and holding greater responsibility is an environment I find 
myself thriving in and becoming more motivated to see success.</p><br />

<p class="longAM">Since becoming a resident in Blackpool, my partner and my career are my main priorities. I have begun teaching myself to program as I 
want to find other ways to contribute to the running of the hospital. Infact, this entire website was a project I pursued to learn and 
appropriate myself with the relevant languages and skills needed to pursue this goal. I have even found ways to put these skills to use
within Information Governance, as my role requires me to post FOI requests to the disclosure log, and this allows me to style and format the data I share
on the official BFWH website with more control with use of coding.</p><br /><br /><br /><br />
