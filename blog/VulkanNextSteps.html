        <h2>Next steps in Vulkan</h2>
        <a href="../index.html" class="homeBtn">Home</a>

        <!-- Chapter 1 -->
        <h4>What's next?</h4>
        <p>
            Previously, we went over the stages using Vulkan from creating a window to displaying an image on the screen.
            This was a high level overview and a few details in between were missed out purposefully. Now I'd like to fill
            in those gaps and dig deeper into the process, particularly around shaders, the graphics pipeline, framebuffers & the swap chain.
        </p>

        <!-- Chapter 2-->
        <h4>Shaders</h4>
        <p>
            Simply put, we write shaders to determine how to render objects in our application. A vert shader handles all of the
            logic that we want to apply to our vertices in the graphics pipeline, and the frag shader deals with the fragments from the rasterizer.
            <br />
            <span class="keywords"> We may have attributes in our Vertex Shader that look like the following:</span> 
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>layout(location = 0) in vec2 position;
                layout(location = 1) in vec3 color;

                layout(location = 0) out vec3 fragColor;
                
                void main() {
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;gl_Position = vec4(position, 0.0, 1.0);
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;fragColor = color;
                }
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>
            The "in" keyword declares a variable inside the vert shader that will be used within the vertex buffers (more on this in the next chapter).
            Whereas the "out" keyword, as seen on 'fragColor' declares a variable that will be passed to the fragment shader after the rasterization process.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="keywords">The Fragment Shader:</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>layout(location = 0) in vec3 fragColor;
                layout(location = 0) out vec4 outColor;
                
                void main() {
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;outColor = vec4(fragColor, 1.0);
                }

            </code>
        </p>
        <p>
            Notice the "in" keyword and that the location is the same as the location set in our vert shader for the fragColor. 
            This fragment shader is ran for every pixel on the screen, whereas the vertex shader is ran for the number of vertices (so 3 for a triangle)
        </p>

        <!-- Chapter 3 -->
        <h4>Vertex Buffers</h4>
        <p>
            These are instructions, written in our vertex shaders, to tell the graphics pipeline how to build models and apply properties like colour.
            A simple vertex buffer where we only want to pass attributes like the vertex position and colours may look like this: 
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>layout(location = 0) in vec2 position;
                layout(location = 1) in vec3 color;
            </code><br /><br />
            <b>Output:</b><br />
            {
                <span class="vbPos">(a, b)</span>, 
                <span class="vbCol">(c, d, e)</span>, 
                <span class="vbPos">(f, g)</span>, 
                <span class="vbCol">(h, i, j)</span>,
                <span class="vbPos">(k, l)</span>, 
                <span class="vbCol">(m, n, o)</span>
            }
            <br />
            <span class="vbPos">position attribute is blue (x, y)</span>, <span class="vbCol">colour attribute is green (r, g, b)</span><br /><br />
        </p>
        <p>
            In the above example we are only using 1 binding which interleaves position and colour. It is possible to separate each attributes
            into it's own unique bindings however for simplicity it's recommended to stick with interleaved.
        </p>
        <p>    
            Even if we separate all of our attributes into their own bindings, all bindings still go into the graphics pipeline together on 
            the same Vertex Buffer. To visualize this, see below:
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>layout(location = 0) in vec2 position;
                layout(location = 1) in vec3 color;
                layout(location = 2) in vec3 normal;
            </code><br /><br />
            <b>Output:</b><br />
            [ { 
                <span class="vbPos">(a, b)</span>, 
                <span class="vbPos">(c, d)</span>, 
                <span class="vbPos">(e, f)</span>
            },
            { 
                <span class="vbCol">(g, h, i)</span>, 
                <span class="vbCol">(j, k, l)</span>, 
                <span class="vbCol">(m, n, p)</span>
            },
            {
                <span class="vbNorm">(p, q, r)</span>, 
                <span class="vbNorm">(s, t, u)</span>,
                <span class="vbNorm">(v, w, x)</span>
            } ]
            <br />
            <span class="vbNorm">normal attribute is red (x, y, z)</span><br />
