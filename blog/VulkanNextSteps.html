        <h2>Next steps in Vulkan</h2>
        <a href="../index.html" class="homeBtn">Home</a>

        <!-- Chapter 1 -->
        <h4>What's next?</h4>
        <p>
            Previously, we went over the stages using Vulkan from creating a window to displaying an image on the screen.
            This was a high level overview and a few details in between were missed out purposefully. In this chapter I would
            like to explain how shaders and the graphics pipeline interact, as well as briefly explaining the roles of Vertex & Command Buffers
        </p>

        <!-- Chapter 2-->
        <h4>Shaders</h4>
        <p>
            Simply put, we write shaders to determine how to render objects in our application. A vert shader handles all of the
            logic that we want to apply to our vertices in the graphics pipeline, and the frag shader deals with the fragments from the rasterizer.
            <br />
            <span class="keywords"> We may have attributes in our Vertex Shader that look like the following:</span> 
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>layout(location = 0) in vec2 position;
                layout(location = 1) in vec3 color;

                layout(location = 0) out vec3 fragColor;
                
                void main() {
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;gl_Position = vec4(position, 0.0, 1.0);
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;fragColor = color;
                }
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>
            The "in" keyword declares a variable inside the vert shader that will be used within the vertex buffers (more on this in the next chapter).
            Whereas the "out" keyword, as seen on 'fragColor' declares a variable that will be passed to the fragment shader after the rasterization process.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="keywords">The Fragment Shader:</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>layout(location = 0) in vec3 fragColor;
                layout(location = 0) out vec4 outColor;
                
                void main() {
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;outColor = vec4(fragColor, 1.0);
                }

            </code>
        </p>
        <p>
            Notice the "in" keyword and that the location is the same as the location set in our vert shader for the fragColor. 
            This fragment shader is ran for every pixel on the screen, whereas the vertex shader is ran for the number of vertices (so 3 for a triangle).
        </p>

        <!-- Chapter 3 -->
        <h4>Vertex Buffers</h4>
        <p>
            This is an object used to pass the vertex data & attributes (written in our shaders) to the graphics pipeline with instructions on how to render objects and apply properties like colour.
            A simple set of vertex shader attributes where we only want to pass vertex position and colour may look like this: 
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>layout(location = 0) in vec2 position;
                layout(location = 1) in vec3 color;
            </code><br /><br />

            <span class="keywords">Vulkan code defining these parameters:</span><br />
            <code>std::vector&lt;Model::Vertex&gt; vertices {
                &nbsp;&nbsp;{ { 0.0, -0.5 }, { 1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f } },
                &nbsp;&nbsp;{ { 0.5, 0.5}, { 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f } },
                &nbsp;&nbsp;{ {-0.5, 0.5}, { 1.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f } }
            };</code>
            
            <p>
                In our examples we are only using 1 binding which interleaves position and colour. It is possible to separate each attributes
                into it's own unique bindings however for simplicity it's recommended to stick with interleaved. Regardless of however we sort our
                bindings, they all still go into the graphics pipeline together on the same Vertex Buffer.
            </p>

            <span class="keywords">Output:</span><br />
            {
                <span class="vbPos">(a, b)</span>, 
                <span class="vbCol">(c, d, e)</span>, 
                <span class="vbPos">(f, g)</span>, 
                <span class="vbCol">(h, i, j)</span>,
                <span class="vbPos">(k, l)</span>, 
                <span class="vbCol">(m, n, o)</span>
            }
            <br />
            <span class="vbPos">Position = (x, y)</span>, <span class="vbCol">Color = (r, g, b)</span><br />

            <p>
                To make things a little clearer, the below code example shows how we would set this up in Vulkan. Firstly they have the same bindings,
                since we want to interleave them. Then the locations are set correctly with those of the shader, the Position attribute's format 
                is defined by a 2d Vector, and finally the color uses a 3d Vector.
            </p>

            <span class="keywords">Vulkan code defining the input attributes descriptions:</span><br />
            <code>std::vector<VkVertexInputAttributeDescription> Model::Vertex::getAttributeDescriptions() {
                &nbsp;&nbsp;std::vector<VkVertexInputAttributeDescription> attributeDescriptions(2);
                &nbsp;&nbsp;attributeDescriptions[0].binding = 0;
                &nbsp;&nbsp;attributeDescriptions[0].location = 0;
                &nbsp;&nbsp;attributeDescriptions[0].format = VK_FORMAT_R32G32_SFLOAT; // vec 2
                &nbsp;&nbsp;attributeDescriptions[0].offset = offsetof(Vertex, position);

                &nbsp;&nbsp;attributeDescriptions[1].binding = 0;
                &nbsp;&nbsp;attributeDescriptions[1].location = 1;
                &nbsp;&nbsp;attributeDescriptions[1].format = VK_FORMAT_R32G32B32_SFLOAT;  // vec 3
                &nbsp;&nbsp;attributeDescriptions[1].offset = offsetof(Vertex, color);

                &nbsp;&nbsp;return attributeDescriptions;
            }</code>
        </p>

        <p>
            It's worth mentioning that when we set each vertex to a particular color, the fragment shader will blend these colors together through a method
            called "Fragment Interpolation". This ensures smooth colouring within our models.
        </P>

        <h4>Command Buffers</h4>
        <p>
            In short, a Command Buffer records and sends commands from the CPU to be queued & executed on the GPU. This means it binds all of our graphics pipeline steps,
            including drawing the vertices, to a "Render Pass" (A recorded set of instructions that sits inside the Command Buffer), becomes queued until executed 
            on the GPU and then put into a Framebuffer which we talked about in the previous blog.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the main reasons the command buffer records this render pass is for optimizing performance. Essentially we can reuse the defined command for
            multiple frames, for when we don't need to draw anything new onto the display. Thus - draw commands wont need to be repeated for every frame!
        </p>

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>
            The aim of this blog was to become more familiar with the steps that interact directly with the graphics pipeline. At this point, we should now be able to understand
            a bit more of the code and process going on within a Vulkan project. If you would like a refresher on the previous blog I'll leave a link below. Thanks for taking
            the time to read through this and I hope it's helped you in some way!
