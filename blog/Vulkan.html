        <h2>Vulkan for complete beginners</h2>
        <a href="../Blog.html" class="homeBtn">Home</a>
        <!-- Chapter 1 -->
        <h4>How does Vulkan work?</h4>
        <p>
            Vulkan is a Graphics API at a much lower level to the hardware than OpenGL, 
            but also meaning more control over all of the inner workings which go into displaying graphics on our monitors.
        </p>
        <p>
            To fully understand how Vulkan is set up, I will first go through the steps to get a project up and running.
            Then in later chapters - break down the steps which need a deeper explanation.
        </p>
        <p>
            It can be quite daunting when we see all the steps necessary, but hopefully by the end of this blog
            you will understand their place and purpose, even as a complete beginner!
        </p>

        <!-- Chapter 2 -->
        <h4>First steps in Vulkan</h4>
        <p>
            Vulkan requires us to do a lot of setting up to begin with. I'm going to abstract the steps needed into an ordered list 
            so you understand what's required, but don't feel like you have to understand every step mentioned thus far.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><span class="keywords">Window:</span> The window which will contain our application</li>
            <li><span class="keywords">Instance:</span> An instance of Vulkan, connecting our application and the Vulkan library</li>
            <li><span class="keywords">Surface:</span> To present rendered images to. (Vulkan is platform agnostic so we can't present straight to the window)</li>
            <li><span class="keywords">Physical Device:</span> We pick the physical device/s (GPUs) that we want to work with</li>
            <li><span class="keywords">Logical Device:</span> We pick the features on the physical device/s which we want to use</li>
            <li><span class="keywords">Graphics Pipeline:</span> Contains instructions for what to render (eg: models) and how (eg: shaders)</li>
            <li><span class="keywords">Framebuffers:</span> Information output from the graphics pipeline which is queued into the swapchain for displaying images</li>
            <li><span class="keywords">Swap Chain:</span> A queue of Framebuffers (usually 2 or 3) that swaps out images to display on our window</li>
        </ol>
        
        <!-- Chapter 3 -->
        <h4>Graphics Pipeline</h4>
        <p>
            The graphics pipeline takes all of the data for our scene and works out what should be rendered - and also how it should be rendered.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><span class="keywords">Input assembler:</span> Takes all of the raw vertex data</li>
            <li><span class="keywords">Vertex shader:</span> Runs on every vertex & puts the model into screen space</li>
            <li><span class="keywords">Tessellation shader:</span> Subdivides geometry, like making flat brick walls look more 3D</li>
            <li><span class="keywords">Geometry shader:</span> A more flexible version of tessellation, although used less due to performance</li>
            <li><span class="keywords">Rasterization:</span> Fragments<span class="refAsterisk">*</span> primitives (a line, point or triangle) & discards any that aren't displayed on screen or behind non-transparent objects</li>
            <li><span class="keywords">Fragment shader:</span> Determines the framebuffers<span class="refAsterisk">**</span> colour & depth values for every fragment</li>
            <li><span class="keywords">Color blending:</span> Pixels may blend to new colour if behind a transparent object such as a window or water, otherwise it may simply override it</li>
        </ol>
        <small><i><span class="keywords">*</span> Fragment: Refers to the data necessary to generate a pixel in the framebuffer, eg: raster position, depth etc</i></small> <br />
        <small><i><span class="keywords">**</span> Framebuffer: An array of information containing how each pixel should be rendered held in memory</i> </small><br/>

        <!-- Chapter 4 -->
        <h4>Framebuffers</h4>
        <p>
            In the 'First steps' chapter it was mentioned that Swap Chains are made up of Framebuffers. These are blocks of memory, output from the graphics pipeline
            and contain properties (aka: attachments) like a "colour buffer" or "depth buffer" which are essentially color values for each pixel that are copied from
            the VRAM of the gpu and presented onto the screen. 
        </p>
        <p>
            You may have heard the term 60hz as a refresh rate on your monitor - this is a standard frequency meaning 60 cycles per second.
            Most of the time, a swap chain will use double-buffering which uses 2 framebuffers at the same time. The framebuffer being displayed is
            referred to as the front-buffer, and the one being rendered to by the graphics pipeline is the "back-buffer". 
        </p>
        <p>
            It's up to the swap chain to decide when to swap these buffers around, this is referred to as V-Sync and essentially swaps them according to 
            the refresh rate (hz) and updates the image on our monitor.
        </p>

        <!-- Chapter 5 -->
        <h4>Swap Chains</h4>
        <p>
            Well now we know what framebuffers are and that our swap chain is full of them, next we will delve a bit deeper into swap chains.
            The swap chain determines a few factors as to how we finally start presenting the images produced by our graphics pipeline to our monitors.
            Some settings include:
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="keywords">Present Modes:</span> Decides how often we should refresh the images from our swap chain
            <ul>
                <li><span class="keywords">FIFO:</span> Causes the GPU to idle until the next refresh cycle (where the swap chain swaps the buffers around)</li>
                <li><span class="keywords">Mailbox:</span> This mode never goes idle so it consistently refreshes with the latest image, meaning lower latency but a higher power consumption</li>
                <li><span class="keywords">Immediate:</span> Ignores the v-sync completely meaning lower latency but high power consumption, and worst of all tearing<span class="refAsterisk">*</span></li>
            </ul>
            <small><i><span class="keywords">*</span> Tearing: a visible artefact what appears as though 2 halves of an image being displayed simultaneously</i></small>
        </p>

        <!-- Chapter 6 -->
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>
            <i class="keywords">So to round up everything we've just gone over even more briefly:</i> <br />
            - The graphics pipeline takes a bunch of inputs such as our models & shaders - outputs a framebuffer which sits in memory as a back-buffer until the swap chain
            swaps it into the front-buffer, causing the image to appear on our monitor.
        </p>
        <p>
            The rabbit hole goes much deeper, however the aim of this blog was to give an abstracted, easy to understand overview of how Vulkan (and most GPU API's) work. 
            I hope this gives you enough knowledge and confidence to start your very own project and good luck on your journey into graphics programming!
