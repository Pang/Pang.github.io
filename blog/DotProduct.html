        <h4>What is a Dot Product?</h4>
        <p>
            A Dot Product is a product of 2 vectors, used to determine the direction an object is facing relative to another object.
            NPC vision in games is a good example of this, especially in stealth games since they need to know if the player is right 
            in front of them so they can begin pursuit.
        </p>
        
        <!-- Chapter 2 -->
        <h4>How to find it</h4>
        <p>
            Many game engines allow you to use libraries to determine a dot product which contain functions like the one below.
            In Unity, the `.forward` is a normalized vector that only considers the objects rotation. <br />
            <code>Vector3.Dot(targetObject, selfObject.forward);</code> <br />
            
        </p>
        <p>
            An important thing to remember is that this doesn't account for the objects position, so if the rotation is <span class="keywords">`Vector3(0, 30, 0)`</span>, then
            the `.forward` property will always output the same <span class="keywords">`Vector3(0.50, 0.00, 0.87)`</span> regardless of it's position in world space. Therefore if you
            do need to check that the target is in range first you will need to do something like: <br />
            <code>float magnitude = (targetPos - fromPos).magnitude;
                return magnitude &lt; radius;
            </code>
        </p>

        <p>
            Both formulas below can be used to attain the Dot Product (<span class="keywords">a·b</span>), remember that a vector between 2 lines 
            (<span class="keywords">|a|</span>) means the magnitude of that vector <br />
            <span class="keywords">a·b = |a| * |b| * cos(θ)</span> <br />
            <span class="keywords">a·b = (ax * bx) + (ay * by) + (az * bz)</span>
        </p>

        <!-- Chapter 3 -->
        <h4>Making it useful</h4>
        <p>
            Regardless of how we choose to calculate our Dot Product, we are returned with the Radians as an output. Radians are a useful measurement and from it we can measure our
            degrees. Let's say for example that our NPC is a monster with huge eyes granting it a large field of view, in Unity we will transform our Radians to Degrees with: <br />
            <code>float angle = Mathf.Acos(dotProduct) * Mathf.Rad2Deg;
                if (angle &lt; peripheralVisionDegrees)
                {
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;// attack player!
                }
            </code>
        </p>
